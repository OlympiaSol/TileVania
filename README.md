## TileVania - Unity 2D Game Project

### Overview
"TileVania" is a 2D platformer game developed using Unity, part of a Udemy course by Rick Davidson. The game draws inspiration from classics like Castlevania, Mega Man, and Spelunky, featuring tile-based level design and platforming mechanics.

### Features
- **Platforming Mechanics**: Run, jump, and climb to navigate through levels.
- **Tile-Based Levels**: Use sprite sheets and tilemaps to create intricate levels.
- **Traps and Enemies**: Avoid obstacles and defeat enemies to progress.
- **Timer**: Adds urgency with a countdown timer for each level.
- **Animation**: Smooth character animations for running, jumping, and climbing.
- **Level Progression**: Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.

### Technical Highlights
- **Tilemap System**: Utilizes Unity's Tilemap system for level design.
- **Sprite Sheets**: Sliced sprite sheets for characters, enemies, and tiles.
- **Animator Component**: Controls character animations through an Animator Controller.
- **Cinemachine**: Implements a follow camera and confined camera settings.
- **Prefab System**: Uses prefabs for reusable game objects like enemies and hazards.
- **Physics Materials**: Applies physics materials to control friction and collision.

### Development Steps
1. **Tilemap Creation**: Design levels using tile palettes and rule tiles.
2. **Character Setup**: Import and slice character sprite sheets, create animations, and set up the Animator.
3. **Player Movement**: Implement running, jumping, and climbing mechanics with appropriate animations.
4. **Enemy Design**: Set up enemy movement and interactions with the player.
5. **Traps and Hazards**: Add and configure traps that can instantly kill the player.
6. **Camera Setup**: Use Cinemachine for a smooth following camera and state-driven camera changes.
7. **Level Progression**: Create multiple levels with increasing complexity.
8. **Game Mechanics**: Implement timers, score tracking, and lives system.
9. **Prefabs**: Create and use prefabs for various game elements to maintain consistency and efficiency.
10. **Audio Effects**: Add sound effects for actions like coin pickups and player death.
